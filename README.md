**Number Guessing Game**

**Overview:**

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python GUI application built using Tkinter. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess the number. The application provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts. Once the correct guess is made, it displays the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.

**Features:**

1. Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Prompts the user to input their guess.
3. Provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
4. Continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
5. Displays the number of attempts once the number is guessed correctly.
6. Resets the game after a correct guess.

**Installation:**

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.

   git clone https://github.com/Santhoshcoder001/PRODIGY_SD_02.git
